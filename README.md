# tower-defense
A simple tower defense game implemented with rlutil library.

Â· For a course project, as a team of two, we created a basic tower defense game using C++ programming
language with rlutil library which runs on CMD window. The goal is the survive 3 waves of enemy attacks. Within these 3
waves, enemies get stronger and they get harder to defeat, so the player can upgrade his/her towers by
using points earned by destroying enemies. There are 3 types of enemies with different special
configurations (faster enemy, stronger enemy and a boss). After surviving the wave, player is challenged
with the boss(currenty removed due malfunction), which is the strongest enemy. Player needs to upgrade his/her towers
to survive all three waves.
